      "* **General purpose buckets** - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ and `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__ requests must match the headers you used in the ``CreateMultipartUpload`` request. \n",

These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal endpoint APIs. After the session is created, you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You also apply the session token to the ``x-amz-s3session-token`` request header for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials will fail.

After the session token expires, you make another ``CreateSession`` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.

Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
